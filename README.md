## Roman Numeral Converter
This project is a JavaScript-based solution that converts a given number (from 1 to 3999) into its Roman numeral equivalent. Built as part of the FreeCodeCamp certification, this project demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and my ability to work with algorithms and string manipulation.

# Features
Conversion Logic: Converts numbers into Roman numerals (e.g., 3 → III, 58 → LVIII, 3999 → MMMCMXCIX).
Edge Case Handling: The program ensures correct output for values within the valid range (1-3999).
User Input: Accepts a number input from the user and outputs the corresponding Roman numeral.

# Technologies Used
JavaScript: Main programming language for logic and functionality.
HTML/CSS: Basic structure and styling for displaying results.

# How to Use
Clone or download the repository.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Input a number in the provided field and click the "Convert" button to see the Roman numeral equivalent.

# Project Purpose
This project helped me solidify my understanding of loops, conditionals, and basic algorithmic thinking in JavaScript. It is also an essential step in my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer.
