# Roman-Numeral-Converter-Project
This project is a JavaScript-based solution that converts a given number (from 1 to 3999) into its Roman numeral equivalent. Built as part of the FreeCodeCamp certification, this project demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and my ability to work with algorithms and string manipulation.
