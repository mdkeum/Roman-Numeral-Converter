## Project Description
The Roman Numeral Converter allows users to input a number (from 1 to 3999) and outputs its Roman numeral equivalent. The conversion is done by mapping the number to a series of Roman numeral symbols and handling edge cases like the number being outside the allowed range.

## Features
- **Conversion Logic**: Convert integers into Roman numerals using a simple algorithm.
- **Valid Range**: Handles numbers between 1 and 3999, which are the limits of valid Roman numerals.
- **User-friendly UI**: The interface allows users to input a number and see the result immediately.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Ensures correct handling of invalid inputs and provides clear feedback.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: The main language used to write the conversion algorithm.
- **HTML**: Basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the user interface, providing a clean and simple design.
